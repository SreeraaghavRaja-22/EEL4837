# Matrices

## A Separate Sparse Matrix Representation

- Standard Definition: `a[MAX_ROWS][MAX_COLS`
- can locate any element quickly by writing `a[i][j]`
- **Sparse matrix wastes space**
  - Must consider alternate forms of representation
  - A matrix where most of the elements are 0

## Matrix Algorithms

- Compute Transpose of Matrix A
- Compute sum of two matrices
- Compute product of two matrices
- Compute the determinant of matrix A
- Write a progam to get the inverse of a matrix A

### Sparse Matrix Algorithms

1. Given a matrix A, write a program to compute the transpose of A.
2. Given two m x n matrices A and B, write a program to comput the sum C = A + B;
